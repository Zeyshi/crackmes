# crackmes
A few CrackMes I wrote for a beginners' CTF.

Most of the original code was taken from https://github.com/LeoTindall/crackmes - you should check out his [tutorial](https://leotindall.com/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) on how to solve these.

I've altared the code to be more suitable for a CTF Competition and added a couple of twists of my own.

You must reverse the algorithm and input the correct password in order to get the correct output (flag).

GL HF!
